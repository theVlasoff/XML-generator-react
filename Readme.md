# XML-generator

# Introduction
Welcome to the XML Generator project! This tool is designed to simplify the process of creating XML files in the ISO20022 format, typically used for swift messages. By taking advantage of an Excel file representing the XML structure, this project dynamically generates an HTML page where users can easily input the necessary values. Once the data is provided, the system generates the corresponding XML file, displaying it on the right side of the HTML interface.
